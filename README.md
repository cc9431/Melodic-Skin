### This is part of an art project that I am helping a friend to create. 
The conversation around race is a difficult but necessary one. People are treated differently based on their what they look like, but when a computer takes our image and breaks it down into pixels and RBG values, we are all simply strings of ones and zeros.
This project is designed to take an image of a person, – preferably with a white* background and white* clothing, in order to isolate their tones – find the most common non-white* colors, and turn those tones into a melody. Each person’s skin, hair, and eyes will contribute to a unique melody.

### I am not the artist in this collaboration, I am the developer, but I believe that the meaning behind this project is powerful and unifying.

# Melodic Skin

required packages: pyaudio, Pillow, math, colorsys

To run: python MelodicSkin.py [name of your image file]

This project is designed to take an image of a person, – preferably with a white* background and white* clothing, in order to isolate their tones – find the most common non-white* colors, and turn those tones into a melody. Each person’s skin, hair, and eyes will contribute to a unique melody.
